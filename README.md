analysis of kickstarter campaigns
# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview
- In this spreadsheet, I took the data from a list of kickstarter campaigns provided by Louise and applied statistics in Excel to find the desired information for Louise to see how other campaigns did compared to hers. The specific information Louise is looking for is the Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals, these a provided further down in this report. 
## Analysis and Challenges
-The start of this analysis was to create additional data from the data provided. This additional data included the percentage of the goal funded, the average donation of each campaign, converting the campaign start and end dates from Unix Timestamps to the day-month-year format, and lastly extracting the year each campaign was ran. Afters this additional data was extracted from the provided data, pivot tables were created sorting out the specific data that was being sought after and charts were created in order to make this data easier to visualize.

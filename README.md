analysis of kickstarter campaigns
# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview
- In this spreadsheet, I took the data from a list of kickstarter campaigns provided by Louise and applied statistics in Excel to find the desired information for Louise to see how other campaigns did compared to hers. The specific information Louise is looking for is the Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals, these a provided with the final excel spreadsheets of the complete data anaylsis. 
## Analysis and Challenges
-The start of this analysis was to create additional data from the data provided. This additional data included the percentage of the goal funded, the average donation of each campaign, converting the campaign start and end dates from Unix Timestamps to the day-month-year format, and lastly extracting the year each campaign was ran. Afters this additional data was extracted from the provided data, pivot tables were created sorting out the specific data that was being sought after and charts were created in order to make this data easier to visualize. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- The Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart shows the data for the each theater campaign sorted by month and whether is was successful, failed, or was canceled. According to this, 839 of the 1369 theaters campaigns were success with 493 that failed, and 37 canceled for one reason or another. The highest number of successful campaigns were started in May and June, with the lowest amount of successful campains launch in December. The month December looks to be split between the amount of succsessful campaigns and those that failed. The highest prevalence of failed campains occurs in the month of October, which is also the same month that no one campaign was canceled. The month of December has equal numbers of successful campagins as it does failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- The Outcomes Based on Goals chart shows the percentage of failed, successful, and canceled campaigns based on campaign goals in increments of 1000 up to 50000 for the funding goals for the subcategory, plays. For plays specifically, there were no canceled campaigns, meaning they were all completed. This chart is not as straight forward between successful and failed campaigns, there are a couple of goals increments were there were more failed campaigns than successful and vise versa, it is not as cut and dry. According to the chart, the campaigns with a lower goal had a higher percentage of successes than failed, but in the 15000 to 35000 there was a greater percentage of failures than success. For campaigns with goals 35000 to 45000 the successes were higher than the failures, with the remaining campaigns with goals greater than 45000 having the least amount of successes compared to failures.
